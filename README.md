## Projects & Repositories

###  Projects
Focused, standalone projects exploring systems, networking, and low-level design.

- **posix-server-nirvana**  
  A minimal HTTP server written in C++ using POSIX sockets.  
  Built while studying low-level networking and HTTP fundamentals.  
   https://github.com/Udbhav-Dubey/posix-server-nirvana
- **Alfred — Terminal Reflection Tool (C++)**  
  A local-first, terminal-based daily reflection tool.  
  Implements manual CSV parsing and hashing in C++ to track habit changes without databases, cloud services, or external dependencies.  
   https://github.com/Udbhav-Dubey/alfred

###  Systems & Networking Experiments
Smaller but serious explorations that live inside my playground repository.

- **Two-way chat room**  
  A simple client–server chat application using sockets.  
   https://github.com/Udbhav-Dubey/ud-playground/tree/main/chat%20room

- **Custom memory allocator**  
  Experiments with bump allocators and memory management strategies in C++.  
   https://github.com/Udbhav-Dubey/ud-playground/tree/main/custom_memory_allocator
  
- **grid-games**  
  Grid-based games (Snake, Maze) implemented as lightweight HTTP servers in C++.  
  Emphasis on server-driven game logic and raw socket communication.
